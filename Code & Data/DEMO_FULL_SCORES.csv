Students are asked the following question: What are two things that you would change about the model to explain where the water goes?

Importantly, it does not matter if the student refers to Libby's model or Taylor's model because both models are identical.

You are to score the responses based on the following rubric:
Direction of Runoff Arrow [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student mentions the water runoff arrow should be pointing in the opposite direction (it currently points uphill, but it should point downhill). 0 points if the student does not identify that the runoff arrow needs to change directions.
Reasoning About Direction of Runoff Arrow [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student received a point for Direction of Runoff Arrow AND provides an explanation or justification for why the runoff arrow should point in the opposite direction that demonstrates mechanistic reasoning with respect to Direction of Runoff Arrow. 0 points if the student did not receive a point for Direction of Runoff Arrow, or if the student did receive a point for Direction of Runoff Arrow but failed to demonstrate mechanistic reasoning with regard to Direction of Runoff Arrow.
Size of Arrows [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student mentions that the arrow sizes need to change (in the model, the absorption and runoff arrows sum to a value larger than the rainfall arrow, which violates conservation of matter). 0 points if the student does not mention that the arrow sizes need to be changed.
Reasoning About Size of Arrows [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student received a point for Size of Arrows AND provides an explanation or justification for why the arrow sizes need to be changed that demonstrates mechanistic reasoning with respect to Size of Arrows. 0 points if the student did not receive a point for Size of Arrows, or if the student did receive a point for Size of Arrows but did not demonstrate mechanistic reasoning with regard to Size of Arrows.

user: I would put an arrow going towards the Stream because some water goes there.

assistant: Direction of Runoff Arrow: The student says ""I would put an arrow going towards the Stream"". At first glance, it seems that the student understands the direction of the runoff arrow needs to change to point downhill towards the stream. However, if an arrow pointing towards the stream is added to the model, but the original arrow is not removed, the model will still be wrong because there will now be two runoff arrows (one pointing downhill and one pointing uphill), when there should only be one runoff arrow that points downhill towards the stream. Because of this, if the student says that an arrow should be added to the model that points downhill in the correct direction, but the student fails to mention removing the previous incorrect runoff arrow pointing uphill, the student does not earn a point for Direction of Runoff Arrow.

Importantly, it does not matter if the student refers to Libby's model or Taylor's model because both models are identical.

You are to score the responses based on the following rubric:
Direction of Runoff Arrow [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student mentions the water runoff arrow should be pointing in the opposite direction (it currently points uphill, but it should point downhill). 0 points if the student does not identify that the runoff arrow needs to change directions.
Reasoning About Direction of Runoff Arrow [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student received a point for Direction of Runoff Arrow AND provides an explanation or justification for why the runoff arrow should point in the opposite direction that demonstrates mechanistic reasoning with respect to Direction of Runoff Arrow. 0 points if the student did not receive a point for Direction of Runoff Arrow, or if the student did receive a point for Direction of Runoff Arrow but failed to demonstrate mechanistic reasoning with regard to Direction of Runoff Arrow.
Size of Arrows [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student mentions that the arrow sizes need to change (in the model, the absorption and runoff arrows sum to a value larger than the rainfall arrow, which violates conservation of matter). 0 points if the student does not mention that the arrow sizes need to be changed.

user: I would put an arrow going towards the Stream because some water goes there.

assistant: Direction of Runoff Arrow: The student says ""I would put an arrow going towards the Stream"". At first glance, it seems that the student understands the direction of the runoff arrow needs to change to point downhill towards the stream. However, if an arrow pointing towards the stream is added to the model, but the original arrow is not removed, the model will still be wrong because there will now be two runoff arrows (one pointing downhill and one pointing uphill), when there should only be one runoff arrow that points downhill towards the stream. Because of this, if the student says that an arrow should be added to the model that points downhill in the correct direction, but the student fails to mention removing the previous incorrect runoff arrow pointing uphill, the student does not earn a point for Direction of Runoff Arrow. Based on the rubric, the student earned a score of 0.

user: I would put an arrow going towards the Stream because some water goes there.

assistant: Direction of Runoff Arrow: The student says ""I would put an arrow going towards the Stream"". At first glance, it seems that the student understands the direction of the runoff arrow needs to change to point downhill towards the stream. However, if an arrow pointing towards the stream is added to the model, but the original arrow is not removed, the model will still be wrong because there will now be two runoff arrows (one pointing downhill and one pointing uphill), when there should only be one runoff arrow that points downhill towards the stream. Because of this, if the student says that an arrow should be added to the model that points downhill in the correct direction, but the student fails to mention removing the previous incorrect runoff arrow pointing uphill, the student does not earn a point for Direction of Runoff Arrow. Based on the rubric, the student earned a score of 0.
