 Stream because some water goes there.",0,0,0,0,0
23225,lables,0,0,0,0,0
23131,One thing I would change about Taylor's model is her arrows direction. For runoff it is pointing left upwards when it should be pointing right downward and flowing downhill like in real life. I would also change the size of the arrows because the rainfall with be the biggest arrow with a lot of water than the absorption arrow which looks bigger than everything else.,1,1,1,1,4
23184,"First, I would change the arrow pointing towards the school, it should point to the stream because if the water was moving towards the school, then the school should be on the lower area of where the stream is. Secondly, I would change the size of the arrows to represent how much water is there.",1,1,1,0,3
19218,I would change the absorbtion to arrows down the Streams and make the rainfall arrow bigger,0,0,1,0,1
23182,changing the direction of the arrows,0,0,0,0,0
19121,"One thing I would change is, I would draw pictures, specifically Of whats happening with direction. I would also explain how each thing a detail is effection the school",0,0,0,0,0
23145,I think that Taylor needs to make the rainfall the biggest arrow because the absorption and runoff is derived from the rainfall. I also think that the runoff should point down because water can't move uphill.,1,1,1,1,4
23194,I would change the arrow going uphill to going downhill to show runoff and I would change the big arrow showing absorption to a small arrow because if theres a lot of absorption there wouldn't be any runoff.,1,0,1,0,2
19319,that runnoff doesnt go uphill and it doesnt absorb that mutch water,1,0,1,0,2
23159,I would add words to desribe the arrows better.,0,0,0,0,0
23233,Rainfall should always be the largest amount because runoff and absorption come from rainfall. If the hill is going down wouldn't the rainfall go down also?,1,0,1,1,3
23141,"I wish he showed where the runoff goes off too and sense it is one main spot where the rain is hitting, he can show that spot compared to other spots that didn't get much rain.",0,0,0,0,0

19404,"flip the runoff to show it goes to stream, show all the details",1,0,0,0,1
23122,"I would change how Taylor has an arrow pointing uphill, towards the school and I would change that to a downhill arrow, towards the stream because water flows downhill. I would also change the arrow coming down from the clouds, symbolizing rain to a larger arrow because this is where all the water is coming from, so it is the largest amount/all the other arrows put together.",1,1,1,1,4
19119,I would show how the water can overflow the stream. More detail on the runoff.,0,0,0,0,0
23208,"I would change the runoff arrow because I can't tell why it points uphill, and I would say what the material of the slope is.",1,0,0,0,1
23201,She could label it better. Switch the thinnest arrow around.,0,0,0,0,0
23226,"1. i would change the direction of the arrow that is pointing towards the school to point to east toward the stream.
 2. i would give more information on what everything is and maybe label something",1,0,0,0,1
23224,"I would change the runoff to going downhill instead of uphill, and I would make the amount of rainfall arrow bigger than the runoff and absorption arrows.",1,0,1,0,2
19122,"One thing is that I would switch the direction of the runoff. Second 
 is that I would switch the size of the water and absorption",1,0,1,0,2
23140,Instead of the arrow going left i would have it going right.,1,0,0,0,1

23142,The arrows show where the water is,0,0,0,0,0
23161,I would change the arrow to be pointing towards the stream.,1,0,0,0,1
19104*,fore the run off it needs to go the other way because water does not run up hill. only down hill,1,1,0,0,2
19201,"I would make the runoff go the opposite direction, and make the rain bigger",1,0,1,0,2
23130,"I would change the direction of the arrow going up, and I would add an arrow going up to show the water that was not absorbed.",1,0,0,0,1
23207,I would use bigger arrows on how much rainfall and keep the other arrows smaller than the rainfall arrow.,0,0,1,0,1
23150,"Two things I would change about Taylor's model to explain where the water goes is to be more specific of where to the rainfall of the water could be absorbed, maybe to add more symbols. Another things Taylor could do better is to show raindrops so if a person didn't know about this challenge they could partially understand the main idea and or point, without explaining or elaborating.",0,0,0,0,0
19307,The run off arrow because I think it the other way downhill. Also having rainfall from every cloud,1,0,1,0,2
23110,I think Taylor could try to make it more know that the arrows were rain and she could get more creative.,0,0,0,0,0
19306,1. the runoff goes to the stream and the runoff is bigger,1,0,0,0,1
23217,"The biggest arrow should be the one that is signaling precipitation, because the water comes from the clouds first. The one pointing uphill would also not be logical, because gravity should make water go down, not up.",1,1,1,1,4
23196,I would make the arrow go downward and connect the arrows.,0,0,0,0,0
23104,Runoff and say what's happening with words,1,0,0,0,1
19424,I would change the direction of the run off and put the absorption arrow in more than one place,1,0,0,0,1

23272,I would change the arrow for runoff because I think its a little misleading,1,0,0,0,1
23220,"1. I would change the arrow to go towards the stream instead of towards the school. 
 2. I would make the arrow that shows the water being absorbed into the ground a little small.",1,0,1,0,2

19223,I would change the runoff to be going downhill I would explain how everything works.,1,0,0,0,1

19214,I would make the runoff going down. I would add more explanation because I don't know what absorption is,1,0,0,0,1
23210,I think the small arrow going to the school because I think it is runoff and when I think of runoff i Think that its going down the hill not up.,1,0,0,0,1
